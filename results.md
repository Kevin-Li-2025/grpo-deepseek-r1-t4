# GRPO Reinforcement Learning Tuning: Version 7 Analysis & Version 8 Upgrades

## 1. Version 7 Diagnostic Results

The Version 7 training run successfully completed on Kaggle. Below is the systematic analysis of the metrics and logs:

### Loss & Reward Convergence (Version 7)
* **Training Loss**: Stably converged (hovering between $10^{-8}$ and $10^{-7}$), showing stable policy parameter updates.
* **Objective Rewards**:
  * `rewards_format_reward_func_mean`: **0.00** across all 100 steps.
  * `rewards_correctness_reward_func_mean`: **0.00** across all 100 steps.
  * `rewards_intermediate_overlap_reward_func_mean`: **0.00** across all 100 steps.
  * `rewards_cosine_length_penalty_func_mean`: Actively converged around **-0.50**, successfully penalizing outputs longer than 600 characters.

### Diagnostic Analysis (Why Format/Correctness were 0.0)
* **The Sparse Reward Trap (Cold Start)**: The base model (`Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct`) generates standard text solutions by default. Our original formatting reward function required a strict regular expression match:
  `pattern = r"^<reasoning>\n.*?\n</reasoning>\n<answer>\n.*?\n</answer>$"`
  Because the base model never generated this exact format by chance in the initial rollouts (group size $G=4$), it received a reward of `0.0`. Since all rollouts in the group got `0.0` reward, the policy gradient for formatting was `0.0` (flat gradient), causing the model to never learn the XML format.
* **GSM8K Evaluation (Manual check)**: 
  The model successfully solves mathematical reasoning problems in normal text mode. For example, in the post-training inference test:
  * **Question 1 (Apples)**: Answered `7` (Correct, but no XML tags).
  * **Question 2 (Bakery)**: Answered `75` (Correct, but no XML tags).
  * **Question 3 (Equation)**: Answered `5` (Correct, but no XML tags).
  Since there were no XML tags, regex parsing of the final answers failed, recording a `0.0%` systematic tag-compliance score.

## 2. Version 8 Upgrades & Systematic Benchmarking

To solve the sparse reward cold-start trap and introduce robust comparison, we deployed **Version 8** with the following upgrades:

### A. Soft XML Formatting Rewards
We added a progressive soft formatting reward (`xmlcount_reward_func`) alongside the strict reward:
```python
def xmlcount_reward_func(completions, **kwargs):
    rewards = []
    for content in completions:
        text = extract_text_from_completion(content)
        reward = 0.0
        if text.count("<reasoning>") == 1: reward += 0.25
        if text.count("</reasoning>") == 1: reward += 0.25
        if text.count("<answer>") == 1:     reward += 0.25
        if text.count("</answer>") == 1:    reward += 0.25
        rewards.append(reward)
    return rewards
```
This gives the policy partial credit (e.g. `+0.25` or `+0.50`) for generating any of the target XML tags, guiding the model step-by-step to output the full structure.

### B. Automated Systematic Benchmarking (`inference_test.py`)
We rewrote the evaluation script to systematically evaluate:
1. **Base Model** (`Qwen2.5-Math-1.5B-Instruct-bnb-4bit`) on 50 GSM8K test set samples.
2. **Fine-Tuned Model** on the exact same 50 GSM8K test set samples.
3. Comparative metrics outputted to a markdown table (`benchmark_report.md`):
   * **GSM8K Accuracy**
   * **XML Format Compliance**
   * **Average Thought Length**

## 3. Current Running Status

* **Training Kernel (Version 8)**: Successfully compiled and pushed to Kaggle with T4 GPU.
  * 🔗 [Kaggle Kernel Version 8](https://www.kaggle.com/code/kevin250304/grpo-deepseek-r1-t4)
* **Next Steps**:
  1. Once Version 8 finishes training, we will run `push_inference.py` to trigger the systematic benchmarking run.
  2. Download `benchmark_report.md` and present the side-by-side comparison.
